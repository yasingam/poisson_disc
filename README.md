# poisson_disc
## My implementation/s of Poisson disc sampling over an image
### This literally just takes an image and make dots out of it spaces at least a minimum distance apart

##### poisson_disc.py added, language - python3
1. The only background I know at this point is random sampling occurs at least a specified distance away from other points
2. As I didn't read existing documentation regarding faster algorithms I just made it up...and it's super slow
3. Consider reading and writing faster code in future
4. You wrote similar code years ago but you forgot why you did what you did. An explanation is to follow here.
